#  Clinical Algorithm Case Study – Pharmedic Internship

This repository contains the work completed by the Product & Technology Interns at **Pharmedic** concerning the case study:  
**"How to Bring the Right Drug to the Right Patient in the Right Way"**, based on a case study presented by Prof. Andreas Bender at the Oncode Accelerator Summit 2024.

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand the real-world complexity of predicting adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
- Propose algorithmic solutions to improve patient-specific drug recommendations
- Explore the impact of data quality, bias, and patient stratification
- Practice using Git, documentation workflows, and team collaboration

---

## 📑 Intern Contributions

Each intern submitted:
- A 2-page technical report (`approach.pdf`)
- A proposed solution or code draft (`solution.py`)

These are located under `/intern_submissions/`.

---

## 🤝 Collaborative Build (Upcoming Weeks)

The `/collaborative_build/` folder will be used to merge the strongest elements from all intern submissions into a unified, peer-reviewed algorithm.
