#  Clinical Algorithm Case Study – Pharmedic Internship

This repository contains the work completed by the Product & Technology Interns at **Pharmedic** as part of the Week 1 challenge:  
**"How to Bring the Right Drug to the Right Patient in the Right Way"**, based on a case study presented by Prof. Andreas Bender at the Oncode Accelerator Summit 2024.

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand the real-world complexity of predicting adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
- Propose algorithmic solutions to improve patient-specific drug recommendations
- Explore the impact of data quality, bias, and patient stratification
- Practice using Git, documentation workflows, and team collaboration

---

## 📑 Intern Contributions

Each intern submitted:
- A 2-page technical report (`approach.pdf`)
- A proposed solution or code draft (`solution.py`)

These are located under `/intern_submissions/`.

---

## 🤝 Collaborative Build (Upcoming Weeks)

The `/collaborative_build/` folder will be used to merge the strongest elements from all intern submissions into a unified, peer-reviewed algorithm.

## gitignore:
This file tells Git which files or folders should be ignored in version control.
It helps keep the repository clean by excluding unnecessary, machine-specific, or sensitive files.
common_ignored_items:
      - "__pycache__/"
      - "*.ipynb_checkpoints/"
      - ".vscode/"
      - ".DS_Store"
      - ".env"
purpose: 
      - Prevents committing temp or local files
      - Avoids OS/IDE clutter in the repo
      - Helps keep the repository clean

## requirements_txt:
This file lists all Python dependencies used in the project.
It ensures that all contributors can install the exact same packages using a single command.
install_command: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
sample_entries:
      - "pandas==1.5.3"
      - "scikit-learn==1.3.2"
      - "matplotlib"
      - "streamlit"
purpose: 
      - Ensures consistent environments across machines
      - Simplifies package management
      - Makes setup easier for new collaborators
